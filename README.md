### **Use Cases**
Here are five main use cases for CAMWorks (SolidWorks CAM) in Markdown format:



- **Automated CNC Programming**: CAMWorks integrates seamlessly with SolidWorks to automate CNC programming, reducing manual effort and errors in generating toolpaths for machining operations.  

- **Feature-Based Machining**: It uses SolidWorks models to automatically recognize machinable features (e.g., holes, pockets, slots) and generates toolpaths based on these features.  

- **Multi-Axis Machining**: Supports advanced multi-axis (3-axis, 4-axis, and 5-axis) machining capabilities for complex part geometries.  

- **Knowledge-Based Machining**: Utilizes a knowledge base to store and reuse machining strategies, ensuring consistency and efficiency across similar projects.  

- **Simulation and Verification**: Provides simulation tools to visualize and verify toolpaths, ensuring collision-free machining and reducing the risk of errors during production.
